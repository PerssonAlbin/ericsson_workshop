#Recommended: Calculate the light threshold.

# It is recommended to set the gain of the proportional line controller. This means that for every
# percentage point of light deviating from the threshold, we set the turn
# rate of the drivebase to 1.2 degrees per second.

# For example, if the light value deviates from the threshold by 10, the robot
# steers at 10*1.2 = 12 degrees per second.
